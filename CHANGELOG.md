# CHANGELOG for create-alpine-disk-image

### Version 0.2 (UNRELEASED)

* Documented QEMU & Virtualbox image creation and use.
* Work-in-progress on getting Syslinux UEFI functional.
* Added support for an LUKS encrypted filesystem. Still a work-in-progress as LUK2 is not yet working.
* Changed script logging to use UTC so that timestamps outside and inside chroot agree.

### Version 0.1 (08/06/2021)

* Initial version. Still undergoing extensive work and testing.
